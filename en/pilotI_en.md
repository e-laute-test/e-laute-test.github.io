### Pilot I
### Variance and Retextualisation in the Music and Text of the Love Song

![](/assets/img/Hofieren_Dohna.png "Federzeichnung aus dem verschollenen Stammbuch des Burggrafen Achatius zu Dohna, um 1550 (Bildzitat nach: Walter Salmen Musikleben im 16. Jahrhundert (Musikgeschichte in Bildern III/9), Leipzig 1976, S. 146")

The studie is an interdisciplinary sub-project in which German studies and musicology will work closely together on the same question. The focus is on the relationship between text and music, the formation of variants and the historical and modern reception of this component. For every work on song intabulations leads to considerations of how and whether the text of the vocal original was understood, heard or thought about? Which text was set to music? Where was the text transmitted or received? What did the text contribute to the understanding of the intabulated music? To what extent did the lutenists take the text into account? How was the parallel reading of text and music and the dialogue of tablature and vocal writing finally to be made possible or shown to the modern recipient?  

The focus is on love songs from the _Königssteiner Liederbuch_ (D-B, Ms.germ.qu.
719; 1470–1473) as examples of ‘collective production’ and ‘open textual types’ (Kern 2005). Several
songs from this book were handed down in several variants in the course of the 15th and 16th
centuries (_Das Schedelsche Liederbuch_ 1459–1467, _Liederbuch der Clara Hätzlerin_ 1470–1471,
_Rostocker Liederbuch_ 1487, _Glogauer Liederbuch_ c. 1480, individual broadsheets or occasion
publications, such as calendars or family books (Stammbücher) of the 16th century; Sappler 1970,
4f.; Petzsch 1965). The analysis of variants offered by our edition makes it possible to examine how
and whether the texts ‘react’ to each other, how the formation of variance changed over time.
Research will also extend to: What social contexts can be established on the basis of semantic,
including metaphoric, references in the text and structural connections of variants? What does
’productive reception’ mean for the _Königssteiner Liederbuch_ (Kropik 2018)? We will investigate the
same in music, especially where notations have been handed down. – How did music and literature
function in the ‘text-event’ mode (Chartier 2000, 5) as both were inseparable? Since four songs nos. 82, 133–135 are included in the edition anyway because of the tablature lines preserved there, we
examine which variants of the melodies could be underlaid (allowing users of the edition to select
among the results), because the linkage to text was not determinate (Sappler 1970, 375). Song no.
82, for example, survives through the references to 'Elßlin' song in _Glogauer_ (1480) and _Ambraser
Liederbuch_ (1582), music prints by Öglin 1512 and Forster 1539, and in several tablatures as
intabulation. We consider how the music was (re)interpreted in the context of the text in later printed
music and especially in the intabulations of the edited tablatures.
