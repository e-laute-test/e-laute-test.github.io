### Pilot IV
### Dialogues about Music
___
This a case study with an interdisciplinary approach of Web science, musicology and performance practice. In the edition it will generally be possible to share all information with recipients via an annotation interface, and to use this to enter into a dialogue with them. Using the example of three closely connected tablatures – the Viennese exemplar of
Judenkünig’s _Introductio & Underweisung_ Vienna 1523 and its handwritten supplement _Stephan Craus
Tabulatur_, A-Wn Mus.Hs. 18688) – the recipients will be invited to react explicitly to all parameters of the
edition. Thus, the dynamic side of the edition will be evaluated.
